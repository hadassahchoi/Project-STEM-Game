Wordle 2.0

This is a modified Wordle Game. The user picks a number from 1-6, which is the number of letters in the word, as well as the number of attempts they get.
The program returns a result. A capital letter means that this letter appears in the secret word, and it’s in exactly the right place.
A lowercase letter  means that this letter appears in the secret word, but it’s in the wrong spot within the word. Note that even if a letter appears twice in the guess but only once in the secret word, both letters will appear in the returned result.
A '*' means that this letter does not appear in the secret word at all.
A correctly guessed word is one point. 

Players can save their score (each correct word guessed increases their score by 1).
